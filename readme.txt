Task is being implemented in Dancer2.

Problems:

was not possible to do requests from my computer
to your resource (when trying to get the authentication token). Probably wirewall/country limitations?


So it was not possible to test the application
locally.

reqbin.com worked fine, however. 

Some amount of time within 2 hours was spent on configuring CPAN
and trying to fix the problem with GET/POST requests from my computer to your
resource. 

The task is not finished regarding the requirements,
I am sending what is done within the 2 hours limit.
